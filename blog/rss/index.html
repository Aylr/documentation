It will mostly focus on data science. If there's a particular topic that interests, <a href="http://healthcare.ai/contact.html">contact us</a>! Some posts will be short, while others will be in-depth. The tone will be informal, with a focus on content and frequent posts (twice per-week) rather than polish. When we talk about doing things with data, we'll post the code, so you can follow along.

<p>When doing healthcare machine learning, why'd we choice R and Python? To be honest, this decision wasn't that complicated. Of course, there are a lot of fantastic statistical tools available today besides just R and Python: Matlab, SAS, Stata, SPSS, and others. While languages like Java, C++, and C# are great, they're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">compiled</a>, which makes them difficult to use for data analysis. We had just a few criteria when narrowing down the list.</p>

<p>1) Was it open-source? <br>
2) Could it do breadth and depth? <br>
3) Did it have wide support?</p>

<p>We wanted something open-source, because free is obviously great, but also because we wanted to be able to contribute to the same community.  Data literacy is important to getting started in most professional careers, and it's fantastic how free tools have democratized entry into many fields over the last decade--we want to support that.</p>

<p>R and Python are the obvious open-source options when playing with data, but how are they on breadth and depth as well as community support? Actually pretty fantastic. Python is often known as the Swiss Army knife of programming languages--it can do machine learning, web development, web scraping, desktop applications, etc. It also does these things <em>well</em>. </p>

<p>While R is more narrowly focused on statistics, it is also great at several things. First, it offers well-documented algorithms and tools for <em>whatever</em> you want to do in statistics. It has fantastic visualizations software (better than Python, it could be argued), and is great at professional document generation for both reports and data education.</p>

<p>In terms of support, here's a plot* showing the popularity of each of these languages:</p>

<p>While there are many other options for doing statistics in healthcare, R and Python are among the very best, and we're excited to use them to improve patient care.</p>

We bring practical, accurate predictive models to health systems interested in improving their operational, financial, and clinical efficiencies. First and foremost, we want to improve patient outcomes. </p>

<p>Machine learning has been used in other industries for years, but healthcare is late to the game. We want to change this. Considering the enormous amount of data in EMRs, the impressive ability of machine learning to detect complex patterns, and the thousands of <a href="http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx">lives at risk</a> in hospitals each day, it's imperative to help healthcare organizations use data to make better decisions. </p>

<p>Instead of health systems hiring expensive data scientists to do this work, we want to help anyone interested in healthcare data—BI Developers and SQL-based folks in particular—develop machine learning skills (via R or Python). </p>

<p>We'll share more details about <a href="http://healthcare.ai">healthcare.ai</a> in the coming weeks, but here's a snapshot of what it encompasses:</p>

<li>A healthcare-specific R machine learning package.</li>
