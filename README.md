## Creating a new blog post using Jekyll

This is the jekyll workflow until we use readthedocs to build for us (hopefully soon)!

1. Add a new blog post source file in markdown format to `jekyll/_posts`
2. Run `jekyll build` from the jekyll directory
3. Run `jekyll server` and check your post [locally in the browser](localhost:4000).

### QA the new post

1. In the top-level repo directory, run `update_jekyll.sh`
2. Run `python -m http.server` to  [locally in the browser](localhost:8000) via  Note: now use port :8000
3. Verify that things like good not only on healthcare.ai/blog, but also /py and /r

### Deploy the new post

1. After verifying the new post, deploy it to healthcare.ai
2. Commit, push, and check the real website.
