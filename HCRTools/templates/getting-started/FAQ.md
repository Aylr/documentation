# HCRTools FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## Who is this project for?

While data scientists in healthcare will likely find this project valuable, the audience HCTools targets are those BI developers, data architects, and SQL-based folks that would love to create appropriate and accurate models on their data. While packages like scikit-learn are certainly irreplaceable, we think that there is a set of data problems specific to healthcare that warrant new tools.

## How does HCTools focus on healthcare?
 
HCTools differs from other machine learning packages in that it focuses on data issues specific to healthcare. This means that we pay attention to longitudinal questions, offer easy solutions specific to data with imbalanced classes, and provide easy connections and deployment to SQL Server.

## Who started this project?

This project began in the data science group at Health Catalyst, a Salt Lake City-based company based focused on improving healthcare outcomes.

## Why was it open-sourced?

We believe that everyone benefits when healthcare is made more efficient and outcomes are improved. Machine learning is surprisingly new to healthcare and we want to quickly take healthcare down the machine learning adoption path. We believe that making helpful, simple tools widely available is one small way to make US healthcare a little less kludgy.
