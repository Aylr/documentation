While packages like scikit-learn are certainly irreplaceable, we think that there is a set of data problems specific to healthcare that warrant new tools.\n\n\nHow does HCTools focus on healthcare?\n\n\nHCTools differs from other machine learning packages in that it focuses on data issues specific to healthcare. This means that we pay attention to longitudinal questions, offer easy solutions specific to data with imbalanced classes, and provide easy connections and deployment to SQL Server.\n\n\nWho started this project?\n\n\nThis project began in the data science group at Health Catalyst, a Salt Lake City-based company based focused on improving healthcare outcomes.\n\n\nWhy was it open-sourced?\n\n\nWe believe that everyone benefits when healthcare is made more efficient and outcomes are improved.
